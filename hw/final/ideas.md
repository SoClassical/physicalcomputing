# Finals ideas

#### 1) Instrument models and each switch plays a different tune on piezo

#### 2) Upgrade trivia game with piezo and LCD screen

#### 3) Momentary switch triggers a different song, played by piezo.
#### Concept: Each momentary switch will be linked to a LED. When pressed, the LED will illuminate and the piezo will play a tune. The LED will turn off when the tune is done playing. Each LED will be covered with a wooden cap kind of thing showing which song is playing.
#### Songs: Mario(?), Flight of the Bumblebee(???), Twinkle Twinkle, Pirates of the Caribbean  
#### Cut: Mario or mushroom, bee, star, pirate
