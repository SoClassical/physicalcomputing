#### Through the use of a temperature sensor, three LEDs which were connected to pins 2, 3, and 4 will turn on one by one depending on the temperature of the sensor. Since the room was a little warmer, I changed the base temperature. As the temperature of the sensor increased, the more pins lit up.

#### Through the use of photoresistors and colored gels, only light of specific wavelengths are let through to the sensor they are covering. The RGB LED has separate red, blue, and green elements inside. Depending on the color of light in the room, the LED is be a certain off-white color. When I turn off the light in the room, the LED's color changes. It also changes when I shine a flashlight on each of the photoresistors individually.
