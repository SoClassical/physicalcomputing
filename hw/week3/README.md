#### I connected three LED lights (1 green, 2 red) to pins 3, 4, and 5 so that when the Arduino is turned on, the green LED will illuminate. A switch is connected to pin 2, so that when the switch is pressed, the code will check the voltage level on that pin. If the switch is not pressed, the voltage level is LOW, meaning the green LED is on and the red LEDs are off. If the switch is pressed, the voltage level is HIGH; therefore, the green LED is off, and the red LEDs are on.
