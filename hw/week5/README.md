# Light Theremin

https://youtu.be/OqM8MH-Q5n4

#### Through using a piezo and a photoresistor, I was able to make a light theremin. Depending on the amount of light that gets through the photoresistor, the frequency changes, changing the pitch that we hear from the piezo. The less light, the lower the pitch, and the more light, the higher the pitch.

# Digital Hourglass

#### Using a tilt switch and six LEDs, I was able to make a digital hourglass. Every 10 minutes, a LED would light up. At the end of the hour, if I tilted the switch, the timer would reset, causing all the LEDs to turn off.
